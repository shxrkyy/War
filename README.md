# War

This is the Friends SMP 2 War. Please read all of it for the full details of what will happen.

# Rules

The rules are below.

PvP Metas: You can only use the PvP Meta assigned with the round. So if the round was assigned CrystalPvP, you could ONLY use CrystalPvP until the round is over.

1 Pop: If you pop 1 totem, that 1 person (not the whole team) will be out for the rest of the rounds. When the entire team pops 1 totem, that team is out.
